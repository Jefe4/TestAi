aiohttp>=3.8.0,<4.0.0
google-generativeai>=0.5.0,<0.6.0 # Added in a previous step for GeminiAgent
PyYAML>=6.0,<7.0 # Should be present for APIManager config loading
requests>=2.20,<3.0.0 # Although being replaced by aiohttp in APIManager, other parts might use it, or it's a common dev dep.
# Keeping existing dependencies is safer. GeminiAgent uses google.generativeai.
# PyYAML is used by APIManager.load_service_configs.
# requests was used by APIManager previously.
# For now, ensure aiohttp is added. If other deps were implicitly assumed, they should be listed.
# Based on previous agent implementations, google-generativeai is needed.
# Based on APIManager's config loading, PyYAML is needed.
# `requests` might have been used by a hypothetical agent or was the previous APIManager backend.
# Let's ensure the critical ones are present.
# The GeminiAgent explicitly imports `google.generativeai`.
# The APIManager explicitly imports `yaml` (implying PyYAML).
# The previous APIManager used `requests`. It's safer to keep it for now if other code might still depend on it,
# or if any agent implementation (not directly modified here) might be using it.
# However, the goal is to make APIManager async, so new direct uses of requests by APIManager are removed.
# For a clean refactor, if no other component uses `requests`, it could be removed, but that's outside this scope.
# Sticking to adding aiohttp and ensuring existing *explicit* dependencies are listed.
